## Form Validation
Form Validation plays a very important role while deploying a Web-App on server. Any input field present on the Web App must be validated wisely, so that an attacker must not take it's advantage. 
We know that an input field is the part of web app by which an user can contact the server. If used for malicious activities, these Input Fields can be manipulated to perform [Input Validation Attacks](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Encoded_Attacks_Threats_Countermeasures_9_30_08.pdf)
Thus, it is very necessary to validate the form / Input field very carefully.
